=======================================================================================================================

This is my sample tutorial project for studying Ruby on Rails. This project is ment for tracking the employees in a computer firm. Through this project the head of the department can assign work to the employees. And he could also keep track of the employees. This is done through catching the screenshot of their desktop every one minute. But there is a problem in my project. The screenshots capturing is working only for LINUS OS. Not in windows or Mac system.
